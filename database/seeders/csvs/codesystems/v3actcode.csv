There are two categories of access control policies, rule-based and identity-based, which are identified in CCITT Rec. X.800 aka ISO 7498-2. Rule-based access control policies are intended to apply to all access requests by any initiator on any target in a security domain. Identity-based access control policies are based on rules specific to an individual initiator, a group of initiators, entities acting on behalf of initiators, or originators acting in a specific role. Context can modify rule-based or identity-based access control policies. Context rules may define the entire policy in effect. Real systems will usually employ a combination of these policy types; if a rule-based policy is used, then an identity-based policy is usually in effect also. An access control scheme may be based on access control lists, capabilities, labels, and context or a combination of these. An access control scheme is a component of an access control mechanism or ""service"") along with the supporting mechanisms required by that scheme to provide access control decision information (ADI) supplied by the scheme to the access decision facility (ADF also known as a PDP). (Based on ISO/IEC 10181-3:1996) Examples: Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) Discretionary Access Control (DAC) History Based Access Control (HBAC) Identity Based Access Control (IBAC) Mandatory Access Control (MAC) Organization Based Access Control (OrBAC) Relationship Based Access Control (RelBac) Responsibility Based Access Control (RespBAC) Risk Adaptable Access Control (RAdAC) >"

LIFE,life insurance policy,"Definition: A policy under which the insurer agrees to pay a sum of money upon the occurrence of the covered partys death. In return, the policyholder agrees to pay a stipulated amount called a premium at regular intervals. Life insurance indemnifies the beneficiary for the loss of the insurable interest that a beneficiary has in the life of a covered party. For persons related by blood, a substantial interest established through love and affection, and for all other persons, a lawful and substantial economic interest in having the life of the insured continue. An insurable interest is required when purchasing life insurance on another person. Specific exclusions are often written into the contract to limit the liability of the insurer; for example claims resulting from suicide or relating to war, riot and civil commotion. Discussion:A life insurance policy may be used by the covered party as a source of health care coverage in the case of a viatical settlement, which is the sale of a life insurance policy by the policy owner, before the policy matures. Such a sale, at a price discounted from the face amount of the policy but usually in excess of the premiums paid or current cash surrender value, provides the seller an immediate cash settlement. Generally, viatical settlements involve insured individuals with a life expectancy of less than two years. In countries without state-subsidized healthcare and high healthcare costs (e.g. United States), this is a practical way to pay extremely high health insurance premiums that severely ill people face. Some people are also familiar with life settlements, which are similar transactions but involve insureds with longer life expectancies (two to fifteen years)."

Discussion: Managed care policies are offered by managed care plans that contract with selected providers or health care organizations to provide comprehensive health care at a discount to covered parties and coordinate the financing and delivery of health care. Managed care uses medical protocols and procedures agreed on by the medical profession to be cost effective, also known as medical practice guidelines.

The POS plan allows a covered party to use providers who are not part of the HMO network (non-participating providers). However, there is a greater cost associated with choosing these non-network providers. A covered party will usually pay deductibles and coinsurances that are substantially higher than the payments when he or she uses a plan provider. Use of non-participating providers often requires the covered party to pay the provider directly and then to file a claim for reimbursement, like in an FFS plan."

REI,reinsurance policy,"Definition: An agreement between two or more insurance companies by which the risk of loss is proportioned. Thus the risk of loss is spread and a disproportionately large loss under a single policy does not fall on one insurance company. Acceptance by an insurer, called a reinsurer, of all or part of the risk of loss of another insurance company. Discussion: Reinsurance is a means by which an insurance company can protect itself against the risk of losses with other insurance companies. Individuals and corporations obtain insurance policies to provide protection for various risks (hurricanes, earthquakes, lawsuits, collisions, sickness and death, etc.). Reinsurers, in turn, provide insurance to insurance companies. For example, an HMO may purchase a reinsurance policy to protect itself from losing too much money from one insured's particularly expensive health care costs. An insurance company issuing an automobile liability policy, with a limit of $100,000 per accident may reinsure its liability in excess of $10,000. A fire insurance company which issues a large policy generally reinsures a portion of the risk with one or several other companies. Also called risk control insurance or stop-loss insurance."

SECCATOBS,security category observation,"Type of security metadata observation made about the category of an IT resource (data, information object, service, or system capability), which may be used to make access control decisions. Security category metadata is defined by ISO/IEC 2382-8:1998(E/F)/ T-REC-X.812-1995 as: ""A nonhierarchical grouping of sensitive information used to control access to data more finely than with hierarchical security classification alone."" Rationale: A security category observation supports requirement to specify the type of IT resource to facilitate application of appropriate levels of information security according to a range of levels of impact or consequences that might result from the unauthorized disclosure, modification, or use of the information or information system. A resource is assigned to a specific category of information (e.g., privacy, medical, proprietary, financial, investigative, contractor sensitive, security management) defined by an organization or in some instances, by a specific law, Executive Order, directive, policy, or regulation. [FIPS 199] Examples: Types of security categories include: Compartment: A division of data into isolated blocks with separate security controls for the purpose of reducing risk. (ISO 2382-8). A security label tag that ""segments"" an IT resource by indicating that access and use is restricted to members of a defined community or project. (HL7 Healthcare Classification System) Sensitivity: The characteristic of an IT resource which implies its value or importance and may include its vulnerability. (ISO 7492-2) Privacy metadata for information perceived as undesirable to share. (HL7 Healthcare Classification System)"
SECCLASSOBS,security classification observation,"Type of security metadata observation made about the classification of an IT resource (data, information object, service, or system capability), which may be used to make access control decisions. Security classification is defined by ISO/IEC 2382-8:1998(E/F)/ T-REC-X.812-1995 as: ""The determination of which specific degree of protection against access the data or information requires, together with a designation of that degree of protection."" Security classification metadata is based on an analysis of applicable policies and the risk of financial, reputational, or other harm that could result from unauthorized disclosure. Rationale: A security classification observation may indicate that the confidentiality level indicated by an Act or Role confidentiality attribute has been overridden by the entity responsible for ascribing the SecurityClassificationObservationValue. This supports the business requirement for increasing or decreasing the level of confidentiality (classification or declassification) based on parameters beyond the original assignment of an Act or Role confidentiality. Examples: Types of security classification include: HL7 Confidentiality Codes such as very restricted, unrestricted, and normal. Intelligence community examples include top secret, secret, and confidential. Usage Note: Security classification observation type codes designate security label field types, which are valued with an applicable SecurityClassificationObservationValue code as the ""security label tag""."
SECCONOBS,security control observation,"Type of security metadata observation made about the control of an IT resource (data, information object, service, or system capability), which may be used to make access control decisions. Security control metadata convey instructions to users and receivers for secure distribution, transmission, and storage; dictate obligations or mandated actions; specify any action prohibited by refrain policy such as dissemination controls; and stipulate the permissible purpose of use of an IT resource. Rationale: A security control observation supports requirement to specify applicable management, operational, and technical controls (i.e., safeguards or countermeasures) prescribed for an information system to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system and its information. [FIPS 199] Examples: Types of security control metadata include: handling caveats dissemination controls obligations refrain policies purpose of use constraints"
SECDATINTOBS,security data integrity observation,"Type of security metadata observation made about the data integrity of an IT resource (data, information object, service, or system capability), which indicates the security mechanism used to preserve resource accuracy and consistency. Data integrity is defined by ISO 22600-23.3.21 as: ""The property that data has not been altered or destroyed in an unauthorized manner"", and by ISO/IEC 2382-8: The property of data whose accuracy and consistency are preserved regardless of changes made."" Examples: Types of security data integrity observation metadata, which may value the observation, include cryptographic hash function and digital signature."
SECINTCONOBS,security integrity confidence observation,"Type of security metadata observation made about the integrity confidence of an IT resource (data, information object, service, or system capability), which may be used to make access control decisions. Examples: Types of security integrity confidence observation metadata, which may value the observation, include highly reliable, uncertain reliability, and not reliable. Usage Note: A security integrity confidence observation on an Act may indicate that a valued Act.uncertaintycode attribute has been overridden by the entity responsible for ascribing the SecurityIntegrityConfidenceObservationValue. This supports the business requirements for increasing or decreasing the assessment of the reliability or trustworthiness of an IT resource based on parameters beyond the original assignment of an Act statement level of uncertainty."
